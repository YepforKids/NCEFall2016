# NCEFall2016
This is the repository holding assignments for students, and place where students can submit their code.

For each new week, we will display a list of exercises for students to complete before the next session. Learning how to code is a marathon not a sprint, and requires a lot of practice! We will go over assignment solutions during class in the following weeks.
